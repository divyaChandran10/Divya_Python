Hi, I'm Ben, the owner of the coolest company in Berlin, the RRB (Rent a Rusty Bicycle). Basically, if you have a BYCICLE 
and do not use it you can become a RBB **PARTNER**. You CAN REGISTER it in our company and start renting it. A RENT is
a contract between the PARTNER and the CLIENT. When a CLIENT rents a bike a BILL is generated informing who is the
client, the partner, and the bike involved also the BILLING METHOD (by KM, by days, by hour), there can be multiple 
billing methods, and it is defined when the BILL is created. Clients very often choose the bike `by age`, 
`by manufacturer`, or by the `type` of the bicycle. A bill is archived, so when the user returns the Bicycle I mark 
the BILL as closed, everytime I create a bill its state is always `Pending`. Bicycles also have a status, when rented
the status is `NOT_AVAILABLE` when at the store it is `AVAILABLE`. I use the closed bills to calculate the 
store total incoming. I want to create a software to manage my rents, I envisage a menu like the one below:

```
1. Rent a Bike
2. Return a Bike
3. List Bikes
4. List Bills
5. Incoming Report
6. Exit
```

Looking forward to having the system!
